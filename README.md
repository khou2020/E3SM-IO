## Parallel I/O Kernel Case Study -- E3SM

This repository contains a case study of parallel I/O kernel from the
[E3SM](https://github.com/E3SM-Project/E3SM) climate simulation model. The
E3SM I/O module makes use of [PIO](https://github.com/NCAR/ParallelIO)
library which is built on top of
[PnetCDF](https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF) and
[NetCDF-4](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf). PnetCDF is a
parallel I/O library for accessing the classic NetCDF files, i.e. CDF-1,
CDF-2, and CDF-5 formats. NetCDF-4 provides parallel I/O capability for
[HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5) based NetCDF file format.
The benchmark program in this repository, e3sm_io.c, is designed to evaluate
the E3SM I/O kernel when using the PnetCDF library to perform the I/O task.
In particular, it studies one of the E3SM's most challenging I/O patterns
when the problem domain is represented by cubed sphere grids which produce
long lists of small and noncontiguous requests in each of all MPI processes.

The I/O kernel is implemented by using PnetCDF nonblocking varn APIs, which
can aggregate multiple requests to a variable or across variables. In addition
to timings and I/O bandwidths, the benchmark reports the PnetCDF internal
memory footprint (high water mark).

The I/O patterns (data decompositions among MPI processes) used in this case
study were captured by the [PIO](https://github.com/NCAR/ParallelIO) library.
A data decomposition file records the data access patterns at the array element
level for each MPI process. The access offsets are stored in a text file,
referred by PIO as the `decomposition file. This benchmark currently studies
two cases from E3SM, namely F and G cases. The F case uses three unique data
decomposition patterns shared by 388 2D and 3D variables (2 sharing
Decomposition 1, 323 sharing Decomposition 2, and 63 sharing Decomposition 3).
The G case uses 6 data decompositions shared by 52 variables (6 sharing
Decomposition 1, 2 sharing Decomposition 2, 25 sharing Decomposition 3, 2
sharing Decomposition 4, 2 sharing Decomposition 5, and 4 sharing Decomposition
6).

### Prepare the data decomposition file in NetCDF file format
* For the F case, the three data decomposition files generated by PIO library
  are in text format with file extension name `.dat`. The decomposition files
  must first be combined and converted into a NetCDF file, to be read in
  parallel as the input file to this benchmark program. Similarly for the G
  case, the six decomposition files need to be converted first.

### To install on Cori
You can change the Pnetcdf and HDF5 path to your customized ones.
```
0. git clone https://github.com/QiaoK/E3SM-IO.git
1. cd E3SM-IO
2. git checkout HDF5_develop
3. autoreconf -fi
4. ./configure --prefix=($pwd) --with-pnetcdf=/opt/cray/pe/parallel-netcdf/1.12.0.1/INTEL/19.1 --with-hdf5=/opt/cray/pe/hdf5-parallel/1.12.0.0/INTEL/19.1
5. make
6. make -j8
```
